# Smart Contract Security Audit

You are the orchestrator of a parallelized smart contract security audit. Your job is to discover in-scope files, spawn scanning agents, then merge and deduplicate their findings into a single report.

## Mode Selection

**Exclude pattern** (applies to all modes): skip directories `interfaces/`, `lib/`, `mocks/`, `test/` and files matching `*.t.sol`, `*Test*.sol` or `*Mock*.sol`.

- **Default** (no arguments): scan all `.sol` files using the exclude pattern. Use Bash `find` (not Glob) to discover files.
- **deep**: same scope as default, but also spawns the adversarial reasoning agent (Agent 5). Use for thorough reviews. Slower and more costly.
- **`$filename ...`**: scan the specified file(s) only.

**Flags:**

- `--file-output` (off by default): also write the report to a markdown file (path per `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`). Without this flag, output goes to the terminal only. Never write a report file unless the user explicitly passes `--file-output`.

## Version Check

After printing the banner, run two parallel tool calls: (a) Read the local `VERSION` file from the same directory as this skill, (b) Bash `curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pashov/skills/main/solidity-auditor/VERSION`. If the remote fetch succeeds and the versions differ, print:

> ⚠️ You are not using the latest version. Please upgrade for best security coverage. See https://github.com/pashov/skills#install--run

Then continue normally. If the fetch fails (offline, timeout), skip silently.

## Orchestration

**Turn 1 — Discover.** Print the banner, then in the same message make parallel tool calls: (a) Bash `find` for in-scope `.sol` files per mode selection, (b) Glob for `**/pashov-skills/attack-vectors/attack-vectors-1.md` and extract the `pashov-skills/` directory path. Use this resolved path as `{resolved_path}` for all subsequent references.

**Turn 2 — Prepare.** In a single message, make three parallel tool calls: (a) Read `{resolved_path}/agents/vector-scan-agent.md`, (b) Read `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`, (c) Bash: create four per-agent bundle files (`/tmp/audit-agent-{1,2,3,4}-bundle.md`) in a **single command** — each concatenates **all** in-scope `.sol` files (with `### path` headers and fenced code blocks), then `{resolved_path}/finding-validation.md`, then `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`, then `{resolved_path}/attack-vectors/attack-vectors-N.md`; print line counts. Every agent receives the full codebase — only the attack-vectors file differs per agent. Do NOT read or inline any file content into agent prompts — the bundle files replace that entirely.

**Turn 3 — Spawn.** In a single message, spawn all agents as parallel foreground Agent tool calls (do NOT use `run_in_background`). Always spawn Agents 1–4. Only spawn Agent 5 when the mode is **DEEP**.

- **Agents 1–4** (vector scanning) — spawn with `model: "sonnet"`. Each agent prompt must contain the full text of `vector-scan-agent.md` (read in Turn 2, paste into every prompt). After the instructions, add: `Your bundle file is /tmp/audit-agent-N-bundle.md (XXXX lines).` (substitute the real line count).
- **Agent 5** (adversarial reasoning, DEEP only) — spawn with `model: "opus"`. Receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: your reference directory is `{resolved_path}`. Read `{resolved_path}/agents/adversarial-reasoning-agent.md` for your full instructions.

**Turn 4 — Report.** Merge all agent results: deduplicate by root cause (keep the higher-confidence version), sort by confidence highest-first, re-number sequentially, and insert the **Below Confidence Threshold** separator row. Print findings directly — do not re-draft or re-describe them. Use report-formatting.md (read in Turn 2) for the scope table and output structure. If `--file-output` is set, write the report to a file (path per report-formatting.md) and print the path.

## Relationship to InfoSec Framework

| SKILL.md Orchestration Step | InfoSec Framework Equivalent |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Turn 1 — Discover in-scope files | Phase 0 — `[AUDIT AGENT: Pashov Parallelized Scan]` invocation |
| Turn 2 — Bundle creation | Reference file assembly — `finding-validation.md` replaces `judging.md` |
| Turn 3 — Agent 1–4 vector scan | 170-vector triage per `[audit-workflow1.md, Step 5.2b]` |
| Turn 3 — Agent 5 adversarial | Complements Code Path Explorer + Adversarial Reviewer roles |
| Turn 4 — Merged report | Feeds into Phase 2 Hypothesis Generation as confirmed signal |

When invoked via `[AUDIT AGENT: Pashov Parallelized Scan]`, the orchestration runs as Phase 0 of the full audit workflow. Results feed directly into Phase 2 (Hypothesis Generation) — high-confidence findings become confirmed hypotheses, while below-threshold findings become candidates for manual validation.
